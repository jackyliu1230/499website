		<p>
		<strong>Dengyao Hou (Daniel):</strong> 
		<br>
		Having initiated the project and defined its objective and scope, Dengyao has assumed 
		the responsibility of managing the project. He will handle the project management side, 
		which involves overseeing the team's progress and coordinating weekly team meetings. 
		His key role in the project will be to ensure the project objectives are met, keep effective 
		communication among team members, and manage the overall project timeline. 
		Additionally, Dengyao will provide assistance to other team members, particularly 
		Jacky, in the digital circuit design aspect of the project. With his pivotal role, Dengyao 
		will keep the team on track throughout the project's execution.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>CheukKi Liu (Jacky):</b>
		<br>
		Jacky will be responsible for the digital circuit design and coding aspect of the project. 
		He will work with an Arduino board (ATmega2560) and perform coding on it. Jacky 
		will be responsible for developing the necessary algorithms for integration of the 
		generator system on the e-bikeâ€™s existing components. His deliverable will be the 
		working functional code and the website develope.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Haris Khattana and	Magai Magai:</b>
		<br>
		Haris and Magai will share responsibilities related to the research for the project and 
		gathering materials and information for the report. Their main responsibility is to 
		conduct comprehensive research on existing generator systems-bikes components and 
		any related technologies helping this project. Their deliverable includes compiling their 
		findings into a well-structured report. They will also assist Kenneth with hardware 
		aspects of the project.
		</p>
	
		<p>
		
		<b> Kenneth Jueves:</b>
		<br>
		The primary responsibility for Kenneth will be to work on the analog circuit side of the 
		project. The focus will be dealing with the DC generator and voltage regulator. He will 
		be assisted by Haris and Magai to select the appropriate generator for the project and to 
		design an efficient power generating system. His tasks will include wiring the generator 
		and voltage regulator and ensuring proper connections.
