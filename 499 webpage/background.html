		City-owned e-bike share programs typically implement a pay-per-minute billing model. 
		In this system, riders are charged for unlocking the bike at the dock and for every 
		minute they have possession of the bike, regardless of whether they are actively riding 
		it. An example of such a model can be found in the e-bike share program operated by 
		the city of Vancouver. Upon unlocking the bike, riders are charged $1.50, and 
		subsequently billed at a rate of $0.35 per minute. While this pricing structure may suit 
		daily commuters traveling directly from point A to point B, it may not be ideal for 
		visitors who wish to leisurely explore the city on an e-bike. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Vancouver's downtown area, along with its beautiful parks and beaches, offers a 
		plethora of attractions that can take hours to fully appreciate. Therefore, expecting 
		visitors to pay $0.35 per minute, or $21 per hour for bike usage may be perceived as 
		excessive. This pricing scheme could discourage tourists who wish to take their time 
		exploring the downtown core and its surroundings, giving the impression that the cityâ€™s 
		e-bike share program is not particularly tourist-friendly.
		</p>
		<p>
		The purpose of this project is to design an innovative e-bike battery charging and 
		monitoring system that aims to offset the cost of renting out e-bikes for the city-owned 
		e-bike share programs. With the increasing popularity of e-bikes in major cities like 
		Vancouver and Victoria, this project seeks to leverage this trend by offering free rentals 
		and a distance-based billing model as incentives to encourage more riders, particularly 
		tourists, to choose e-bikes for their daily commutes and recreational activities.
		</p>
		The proposed system centers on the development and implementation of an e-bike 
		battery charging and monitoring system. This system will enable riders to charge the 
		battery while riding, thereby offsetting the cost of rental for the city. To achieve this, a 
		DC generator and voltage regulator will be installed on the e-bikes, allowing riders to 
		contribute to the energy supply during their ride. Although this setup may introduce 
		additional drag, the trade-off is that riders will enjoy a free rental experience. 
		Furthermore, riders will be entitled to utilize the same amount of energy they charged 
		in power assist mode, enhancing their overall riding experience and further 
		incentivizing the use of e-bikes.
		<p>
		The energy charging and consumption will be measured and monitored by a battery 
		monitoring system. This system will provide real-time data on energy usage, ensuring 
		accurate energy metering of the e-bike. This advancement also opens the door to a fairer 
		and more transparent distance-based billing model, eliminating the shortcomings of the 
		pay-per-minute model. Riders can now enjoy accurate and equitable billing, which 
		reflects the actual energy usage during their rental period.
